Front-End Code Test

The challenge is to convert code-test.psd into HTML. Our recommendation is to not spend too much time trying to get it perfect,
but demonstrate your skills through well structured code and industry standard conventions. This means code formatting, comments and readable variable names. This will be our primary assessment focus.

Included is the data file, images and PSD.

Requirements:
• Build with client-side Javascript
• Read data from JSON
• Responsive Layout
• Build dropdown filters from data
• Hide and show data depending on the dropdown filters

Don’t forget:
• Browser testing - IE9+ and modern browsers
• Scalable content (ie – adding extra data does not break design)

You may use MV* or any framework you wish, however we encourage you not to use pre-made boilerplates, and to only use what is needed for this task. We want to see what you can do.

Please submit your code through Github or Bitbucket, and include installation instructions.

I am available for any questions you may have, and would encourage you to send through whatever you get through, as getting it right in the browser is not the only thing we will be looking at.
